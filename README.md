# Description

This is a repository of misc MATLAB functions and scripts. I hope someone finds them useful.

# List of files
- detectFileAndPlot.m - monitors a directory for a new file then plots the data within
- serial-sendmulator.m - sends a 8bit sine wave signal to the serial port
- serialPortPlot.m - buffers data from the serial port and plots it
- SRD_plotter.m - plots data from all files within a directory that were recorded from the SRD for publication purposes.
- step_response_to_freq_response.m - takes step response data and computes and plots the frequency/magnitude response


## Todo
- add more files
- mark each file as fxn or script
- Make sure all files have full internal documentation
- Maybe have a wiki page for more complex code and show images
- make sure all files have usage examples
- add most useful code to Mathworks File Exchange
